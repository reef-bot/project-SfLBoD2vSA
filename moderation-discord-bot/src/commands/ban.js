In this code, we have implemented the ban command for the Discord bot. It checks if the user invoking the command has the necessary permissions, mentions the user to be banned, and then proceeds to ban the user with a reason. After banning the user, it logs the action and removes any roles associated with the banned user. Error handling is included to handle any issues that may arise during the ban process.Dependencies on the logging and role system modules are also specified.
